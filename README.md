Enter a phone number to determine all of the possible letter combinations. 

## Inspiration

This website was inspired by a LeetCode problem:

> Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/

I thought it would take a few minutes to solve this problem but I was wrong :)
Fun fact: The phone number 999-9999 has 16,384 possible letter combos.
