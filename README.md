## The Inspiration

This website was inspired by a LeetCode problem:

> Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/

## The Process

I thought it would take a few minutes to solve this problem in JavaScript but I was wrong! I was determined to figure out a working solution myself before checking the answer. My solution is not as elegant as the one provided by LeetCode, but now I know what to do next time.

## Fun Stuff

Fun fact: The phone number 999-9999 has 16,384 possible letter combinations. That's because the keypad number 9 has 4 letters, giving us 4^7 = 16,384.
